In scenarios where Autobinding is not feasible for a specific group of I/O points, the recommended alternative is to dynamically assign the input source of I/O attributes through a generic script placed within the template object. This method maintains scalability and reduces repetitive manual configuration across multiple instances.

To implement this effectively, it is important to reserve two configuration attributes within the object template:

`cfgDeviceName` – Represents the Device Integration (DI) object name.

`cfgScanGroup` – Specifies the scan group within the device.

These configuration attributes enable the script to programmatically construct and assign the appropriate input source references at runtime.

Refer to the syntax here:

In line with the naming conventions outlined in [2. Attribute Structure](https://github.com/PabloAsensiGarcia/AVEVA-System-Platform/blob/main/System-Design-Philosophy/2.%20Attribute%20Structure.md), configuration-related attributes are prefixed with cfg, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the application structure. This approach enhances maintainability and reinforces good design practices across the object hierarchy.
