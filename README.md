# AVEVA System Platform Development Guidelines

This repository is a curated collection of development standards, scripting examples, and practical resources that I have developed and refined over the course of working extensively with AVEVA System Platform (formerly Wonderware). It is intended to support engineers, developers, and system integrators by offering structured guidance and reusable solutions for common challenges in industrial automation projects.

The content ranges from scripting patterns and best practices to design templates and architectural guidelines aimed at promoting clarity, scalability, and maintainability within System Platform environments. Whether you're building a system from scratch or refining an existing deployment, this repository provides actionable insights that can help accelerate development while maintaining high engineering standards.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Best Practices

Designing an effective AVEVA System Platform architecture involves strategic distribution of roles and components. Key considerations include:

- **Role-Based Distribution**: Assign specific roles to nodes, such as Galaxy Repository Server, IDE Client Node, Application Object Servers (AppEngines), InTouch Runtime Nodes, Historian Node, License Server, and System Monitor Manager/Agent.

- **Separation of Critical Roles**: Host the Galaxy Repository, Historian, and License Server on separate nodes to enhance performance and security.

- **Redundancy**: Implement redundant configurations for AppEngines and License Servers to ensure high availability.

- **Network Configuration**: Ensure proper network setup with static IPs or reserved DNS, and configure firewalls to allow necessary ports.

- **Scalability**: Plan for scalability by considering scan rates, I/O loads, and tag counts across AppEngines.

- **System Monitoring**: Deploy System Monitor Agents on all nodes and centralize monitoring through the System Monitor Manager.

- **Backup & Recovery**: Regularly back up the Galaxy Repository and test restore procedures for critical components.

- **Development Lifecycle Management**: Maintain separate environments for development, staging, and production, and manage object templates with version control.
