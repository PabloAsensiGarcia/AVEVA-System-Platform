# AVEVA-System-Platform

This repository serves as a centralized collection of useful scripts and resources that I’ve developed and refined throughout my experience working with AVEVA System Platform (formerly Wonderware). It is intended to support engineers, developers, and integrators by providing practical solutions to common challenges encountered in industrial automation projects. 

The contents range from object scripting examples—designed to streamline development within the IDE—to templates and tools that assist in designing efficient and scalable system architectures. 

Whether you're troubleshooting, prototyping, or building a production-ready system, this repository aims to offer reusable components and insights that can save time and improve project outcomes.
